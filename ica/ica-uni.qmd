### Importance of Visualizations

### Exercise 1: Research Questions {.unnumbered}

Let's dig into the `hikes` data, starting with the `elevation` and difficulty `ratings` of the hikes:

```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
head(hikes)
```

a.  What features would we like a visualization of the *categorical* difficulty `rating` variable to capture?

***Difficulty captured in ascending order and same category difficulty captured together***

b\.
What about a visualization of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable?

***They should be arranged by difficulty or by descending order or elevation***

### Exercise 2: Load tidyverse {.unnumbered}

We'll address the above questions using `ggplot` tools.
Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message -- this is one you'll get a lot!

```{r}
# Use the ggplot function
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

In order to use `ggplot` tools, we have to first *load* the `tidyverse` package in which they live.
We've *installed* the package but we need to tell R when we want to *use* it.
Run the chunk below to load the library.
You'll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses `ggplot()`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false

# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
```

### Exercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1 {.unnumbered}

Consider some specific research questions about the difficulty `rating` of the hikes:

1.  How many hikes fall into each category?

```{r}
# Shows the number of each difficulty rating in the table
table(hikes$difficulty)
```

2.  Are the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?

    ***They are not evenly distributed***

All of these questions can be answered with: (1) a **bar chart**; of (2) the *categorical* data recorded in the `rating` column.
First, set up the plotting **frame**:

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

Think about:

-   What did this do? What do you observe? ***Gave a chart of the dificulty ratings with nothing on it***
-   What, in general, is the first argument of the `ggplot()` function? ***Descibes the data set from which the data should come from***
-   What is the purpose of writing `x = rating`? It makes rating the x axis
-   What do you think `aes` stands for?!? ***Maybe aesthetics of the chart***

### Exercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

Now let's add a **geometric layer** to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot's **theme**.
To this end, try each chunk below, *one by one*.
In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

NOTE:

-   Pay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.
-   Not all of these are "good" plots. We're just exploring `ggplot`.

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar()
# ggplot assigned its own labels
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
# Gave labels for the bar charts
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
# colored the bar charts blue
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
# The borders became orange and fill color of the bar charts became blue
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue")  +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes") +
  theme_minimal()

# The background color became transparent
```

### Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Reflect on the `ggplot()` code.

-   What's the purpose of the `+`? When do we use it? ***To add a function to an already existing argument***
-   We added the bars using `geom_bar()`? Why "geom"? ***It makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of casings at the bottom***
-   What does `labs()` stand for? \# Labels
-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`? ***Color makes the border while Fill makes the color of the bar inside***

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

In general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a *categorical* variable:

-   **observed categories**: What categories did we observe? ***Difficult, moderate and easy***
-   **variability between categories**: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? ***Some are more common that others***

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks.
Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.

***There are some hikes that are more common than others based on the rating of the difficulty.***

#### Part c {.unnumbered}

Is there anything you don't like about this barplot?
For example: check out the x-axis again.

***Moderate should have been between easy and difficult***

### Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart {.unnumbered}

Let's now consider some research questions related to the *quantitative* `elevation` variable:

1.  Among the hikes, what's the *range* of elevation and how are the hikes *distributed* within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, "normally")?
2.  What's a *typical* elevation?
3.  Are there any *outliers*, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?

Here:

-   Construct a **bar chart** of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable.
-   Explain why this might *not* be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn't it help answer?)

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_bar()  +
  labs(x = "Elevation", y = "Range") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation {.unnumbered}

Quantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables.
Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable.
It's typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we've observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above.
It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range.
We'll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: **histograms** and **density plots**.

**Histograms** are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into 'bins' of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin.
Check out the example below:

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/histogram_demo.png){width="50%"}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Let's dig into some details.

-   How many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?
    ***6***

-   How many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?
    ***2***

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Now the bigger picture.
In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a *quantitative* variable:

-   **typical outcome:** Where’s the center of the data points? What's typical?
-   **variability & range:** How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?
-   **shape:** How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?
-   **outliers:** Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks.
Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.

***Elevations have a range of between 3700 to 5500 and are normally distributed.***

### Exercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1 {.unnumbered}

2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to *intuit* what line you can tack on to the below frame of `elevation` to add a histogram layer.
Don't forget a `+`.
If it doesn't come to you within 2 minutes, *no problem* -- all will be revealed in the next exercise.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()
         
```

### Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

Let's build some histograms.
Try each chunk below, *one by one*.
In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()

# It creates a histogram instead of a bar graph.
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 

# Demarcates/Outlines the bars in white.
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 

# Histogram bars are filled in white.
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Has labeled axis.
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# It changes the width to 1000feet.
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# It changes the width to 5.
```

```{r}
# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# It changes the width to 200.
```

### Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up {.unnumbered}

-   What function added the histogram layer / geometry? ***geom_histogram()***
-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`? ***Color only covers the border while Fill covers inside the bar***
-   Why does adding `color = "white"` improve the visualization? ***It makes the demarcations of the bins in the histograms more visible.***
-   What did `binwidth` do? ***It determines the width of the bins***
-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? ***It does not show the differences***
-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? ***Becomes too much to digest, and might not be able to seee the pattern or bigger picture***

### Exercise 11: Density Plots {.unnumbered}

**Density plots** are essentially smooth versions of the histogram.
Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the "density" of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes.
The greater the number of observations, the greater the density!
The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve **always equals 1** and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.

Check out a density plot of elevation.
Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation -- it's a relative measure.
The *higher* the density, the more *common* are elevations in that range.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density()
```

**Questions**

-   INTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to `geom_bar()` and `geom_histogram()`, how do you *anticipate* the following code will change the plot?

    -   `geom_density(color = "blue")` ***the line will be blue***
    -   `geom_density(fill = "orange")` ***the area under the line will be blue***

-   TRY IT!
    Test out those lines in the chunk below.
    Was your intuition correct?

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
 geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange")
```

-   Examine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the *typical* elevation, *variability / range* in elevations, and *shape* of the distribution of *elevations* within this range? ***There is a commanality in the range of 4200 to 4800. The higher the elevation the less the commonality there is.***

### Exercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms {.unnumbered}

The histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers.
What are the pros/cons of each?
What do you like/not like about each?

**Histogram:** -*easy for frequency countn*

*- good for making calculations*

**Density plot** *- good for visualization*

*- hard for making interpretations due to a large bandwidth*

### Exercise 13: Code = communication

We *obviously* won't be done until we talk about communication.
All code above has a similar *general* structure (where the details can change):

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + 
  geom___(color = "___", fill = "___") + 
  labs(x = "___", y = "___")
```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to *indent* or *tab* the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why? \# Its much easier to read

```{r}
# YUCK
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Not easy to read
```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to put a *line break* after each `+` (counterexample below). Why?

```{r}
# YUCK 
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Too long.
```

```

### Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

-   To indicate we're still adding layers to / modifying our plot.
-   Bars are the `geom`etric elements we're adding in this layer.
-   labels
-   `fill` fills in the bars. `color` outlines the bars.

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Most hikes are moderate, the fewest number are difficult.

#### Part c {.unnumbered}

I don't like that the categories are alphabetical, not in order of difficulty level.

### Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart {.unnumbered}

There are too many different outcomes of elevation.

```{r}
#| eval: true

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

### Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

-   6
-   1 + 1 = 2

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Elevations range from roughly 3700 to 5500 feet.
Elevations vary from hike to hike relatively *normally* (with a bell shape) around a typical elevation of roughly 4500 feet.

### Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Add a histogram layer
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Outline the bars in white
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 

# Fill the bars in blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 

# Add axis labels
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Change the width of the bins to 1000 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Change the width of the bins to 5 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Change the width of the bins to 200 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

### Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up {.unnumbered}

-   `geom_histogram()`
-   `color` outlined the bars and `fill` filled them
-   easier to distinguish between the bars
-   changed the bin width
-   we lump too many hikes together and lose track of the nuances
-   we don't lump enough hikes together and lose track of the bigger picture trends

### Exercise 11: Density plots {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| eval: true

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
 geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange")
```

### Exercise 13: Code = Communication {.unnumbered}

-   Clarifies that the subsequent lines are a continuation of the first. That is, we're not done with the plot yet. These lines are all part of the same idea.
-   This is like a run-on sentence. It's tough to track the distinct steps that go into building the plot.
