#| fig-alt: "A scatter plot displaying the relationship between the percentage of Republican votes in 2016 and 2020 across U.S. counties. Each point represents a county, with its position showing the percentage of Republican votes in 2016 (x-axis) and 2020 (y-axis). The trend indicates how counties shifted in Republican support between the two elections."
